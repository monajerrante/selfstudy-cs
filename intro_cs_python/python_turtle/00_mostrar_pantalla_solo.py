import turtle

# Creando una pantalla de tortuga
s = turtle.getscreen()
# Para detener la pantalla para mostrar
turtle.mainloop()

'''
The screen same as the canvas and turtle acts like a pen.
You can move the turtle to design the desired shape.
The turtle has certain changeable features such as color,
speed, and size. It can be moved to a specific direction,
and move in that direction unless we tell it otherwise.

In the next section, we will learn to program with
the Python turtle library.
